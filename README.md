This is the project repo for the Central Intelligence Aggies Howdy hack 2020 team. 

The application is meant to be a short game that teaches some cybersecurity concepts
while also telling a short little story. 

### This project Won the Aggie School Spirit Award !

### How to Run the App
It is just a python project, so running the application using
a python version 3.6 or greater should work just fine.
